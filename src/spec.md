# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the missing “Gold & Silver Rates” dummy-data section on the User Portal Dashboard for all authenticated users and ensure the correct ArthaNidhi Pay logo is used consistently in the User Portal.

**Planned changes:**
- Add/restore a clearly labeled “Gold & Silver Rates” section on the User Portal Dashboard that always renders for any logged-in user (including existing users).
- Include dropdown controls for Indian capital city, karat (18/22/24), and weight (1g/10g/100g/1000g), and update displayed dummy INR (₹) prices immediately when selections change.
- Fix User Portal header and footer to reference the correct ArthaNidhi Pay logo asset consistently, and keep English alt text that accurately describes the logo.

**User-visible outcome:** Logged-in users see a working “Gold & Silver Rates” section on the Dashboard with interactive dropdowns and INR-formatted dummy prices, and the User Portal header/footer show the correct ArthaNidhi Pay logo.
