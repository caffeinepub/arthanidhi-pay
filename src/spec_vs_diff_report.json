  "summary": "The diff adds documentation for a chat-based export format and reconstruction guide, and it also modifies multiple frontend UI/components (e.g., dashboard news card and sidebar). However, it does not implement the core BuildRequest requirement of delivering the complete frontend+backend source code and step-by-step reconstruction/run instructions directly in the chat output; instead it adds/updates repository files and UI content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-66",
      "requirement": "Deliver the complete project source code (frontend + backend) directly in the chat in a copy/paste-friendly, file-by-file format with paths and full contents.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows added documentation and a truncated summary file; it does not provide the complete repository code file-by-file (including backend code) in chat, nor does it show changes that would cause chat to output the entire codebase.",

      "requirement": "Include clear, step-by-step instructions (in chat) for reconstructing the project locally, env var setup from existing .env example files, and copy-paste-ready commands to run frontend and backend.",
      "reason": "While a reconstruction guide file appears to be added, the BuildRequest requires these instructions to be included in the chat output. The diff does not show chat-delivered instructions, and the added guide content is truncated and does not demonstrate referencing the existing example .env files or providing full run commands.",
