  "summary": "REQ-53 is partially implemented by applying a dark-mode body background image in `frontend/src/index.css`, but REQ-52 is not met because the required image asset was not added. The diff also includes broader global theme/color-variable changes that were not explicitly requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-52",
      "requirement": "Add a new premium, high-resolution dark-mode fintech background image under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with the exact filename `banking-bg-dark-india.dim_3840x2160.png`, containing no people/text/logos/watermarks and matching the specified India-focused palette and style.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, and specifically no new PNG asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`. Only CSS references the expected path.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" / \"ADDED FILES: - none\"",
        "frontend/src/index.css (references `/assets/generated/banking-bg-dark-india.dim_3840x2160.png` but does not add it)"

    {
      "description": "Broad replacement/adjustment of the global color system (many OKLCH CSS variables for light and dark themes) beyond simply applying the requested background image.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on generating and applying a background image while avoiding redesign/layout changes beyond what’s necessary for readability. The diff shows extensive updates to theme variables not directly tied (in the diff) to background application or contrast fixes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (large changes to :root and .dark CSS variables)"
