  "summary": "Diff implements KYC fields end-to-end (frontend validation + backend persistence with upgrade-safe migration) and adds a protected Gold & Silver Rates page/route with nav entry. Logo references were updated across Header/Footer/Login to a new asset path, and global background tokens were changed to solid colors (no visible gradients in shown code). One unrelated footer attribution/link appears added.",
