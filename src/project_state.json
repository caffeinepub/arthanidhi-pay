  "summary": "Expand ArthaNidhi Pay into a more complete India-standard banking web app: add mandatory KYC during signup with uploads and optional fields, admin portal (separate frontend+backend) to review/approve KYC and change requests with maker/checker roles, auto-approve KYCs when all mandatory fields are filled while still visible to admin, generate unique Customer ID (ARTHA + 12 digits) and 16-digit account number upon activation, support account-to-account transfers, joint accounts (secondary holders), user/admin forgot-reset password flows, contact/communication address page with map, dashboard greeting with time/date, inactivity auto-logout, and separate env configs for user vs admin plus dev/stage/prod; continue Node.js (CommonJS) + PostgreSQL backend approach for external runs.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Site-wide header/footer shared across all pages with consistent ArthaNidhi Pay branding (name + logo).",
    "Currency formatting should use INR (₹) for all monetary values displayed in the UI.",
    "Internet Computer canisters cannot call external payment APIs; to support real payment gateways when running the code externally, use a Node.js (or other standard) backend that can make outbound HTTP calls, while keeping the React frontend.",
    "Node.js backend implementation choice confirmed: CommonJS (require) style (e.g., server.js).",
    "Planned external backend datastore: PostgreSQL connected from Node.js backend for users/accounts/transactions/transfers.",
    "Node.js external REST backend folder should be named exactly `backend-node`.",
    "Add a separate Admin Portal (separate frontend + backend) within the same repo, sharing branding/theme but isolated via its own environment configuration.",
    "KYC-driven onboarding: users remain inactive until KYC is approved; if mandatory fields are completed, KYC can be auto-approved but still visible in admin.",
    "On activation, auto-generate and persist unique IDs: Customer ID format `ARTHA` + 12 digits and a separate 16-digit Account Number.",
    "Implement session inactivity timeout (5 minutes) with automatic logout for both user and admin portals."
