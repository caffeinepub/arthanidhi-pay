  "summary": "Phase 1 change: apply the newly requested UI/content/feature updates ONLY to the ArthaNidhi Pay (User Portal) first, with NO data integration with the Admin Portal for now. User portal will include: new logo (replace everywhere) + updated footer copyright, global sunrise + neon sky-blue + peacock-feather mixed gradient background theme, full KYC form during signup with auto-approval if mandatory fields are filled, account view showing auto-generated Customer ID + Account Number (including auto-generation for existing users missing these), money transfer feature with real balance updates (using dummy/seed initial balances), updated dashboard greeting with username + local timezone date/time, move logout from dashboard into header (header-only), dark mode toggle across pages, left sidebar menu with all pages, dummy market/stocks/mutual-funds data, and a gold/silver rates module with dropdowns (Indian capital city, karat 18/22/24, weights 1g/10g/100g/1000g), plus a world+India financial news section (dummy).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Site-wide header/footer shared across all pages with consistent ArthaNidhi Pay branding (name + logo).",
    "Currency formatting should use INR (₹) for all monetary values displayed in the UI.",
    "Internet Computer canisters cannot call external payment APIs; to support real payment gateways when running the code externally, use a Node.js (or other standard) backend that can make outbound HTTP calls, while keeping the React frontend.",
    "Node.js backend implementation choice confirmed: CommonJS (require) style (e.g., server.js).",
    "Planned external backend datastore: PostgreSQL connected from Node.js backend for users/accounts/transactions/transfers.",
    "Node.js external REST backend folder should be named exactly `backend-node`.",
    "Add a separate Admin Portal (separate frontend + backend) within the same repo, sharing branding/theme but isolated via its own environment configuration.",
    "KYC-driven onboarding: users remain inactive until KYC is approved; if mandatory fields are completed, KYC can be auto-approved but still visible in admin.",
    "On activation, auto-generate and persist unique IDs: Customer ID format `ARTHA` + 12 digits and a separate 16-digit Account Number.",
    "Implement session inactivity timeout (5 minutes) with automatic logout for both user and admin portals."

    "Logout button is still displayed on the Dashboard; should be shown only in the header.",
    "New logo replacement not yet applied consistently across all pages (should replace everywhere).",
    "Logo asset selection is incorrect; user requests reverting to the previous logo (use the provided logo / previous logo consistently across the portal).",
    "Signup: Full KYC form is still not showing during signup (should be visible and required per Phase 1 scope).",
    "Visual theme: Background/gradient currently applied is not the earlier agreed background color/theme; revert to the earlier background and do not use the current gradient.",
    "Gold & Silver Rates: The Gold/Silver rates module/page is still not showing (user reports it missing; should be visible for all authenticated users).",
